This is a collection matlab code including class objects for mathamatical concepts for future built ins in data rangling.
---

These objects are used to determine relative distances between coordinate systems in order to separate data using hyperplanes for visualization.
Concepts can be found in "Convex Optimization" by Stephan Boyd https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf 
The concepts in Boyd's Manual utilize understanding of "Linear Algebra and its Applications," by David Lay and "Linear Programming and Extensions," by Danzig.
