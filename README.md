.m files
These files are used to determine relative distances between coordinate systems in order to separate data using hyperplanes for visualization.
Concepts can be found in "Convex Optimization" by Stephan Boyd https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf 
The concepts in Boyd's Manual utilize understanding of "Linear Algebra and its Applications," by David Lay and "Linear Programming and Extensions," by Danzig.

.pynb files
These files describe several different methods of delineating data for the purposes of storage, compression, and analysis.
Concepts for the code can be found in "Probabilistic Machine Learning," by Kevin Murphy, "Introduction to Coputation and Programming in Python," by John Guttag and 
"Python Data Science Handbook," by Jake Vanderplas.
